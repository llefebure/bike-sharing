# Analyzing the Bay Area Bike Share System

In this project, I experiment with data provided by the [Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data) system. I think bike sharing networks are an interesting concept, so this serves as an exploratory and educational platform for me.

In the Rmd directory, there are several .md files in which I look at specific questions:

* gmaps_cycling_estimates.md: I compare the actual trip duration of trips in the BABS system to Google Maps cycling estimates. This gives some quantitative insight into how accurate those estimates actually are.
